# rock-paper-scissors
This is a simple program that lets the user play rock, paper, scissors
in the console against the computer. The user will answer through prompt pop-ups
and they will play a best of five game. The program will display a message to the console instead
of throwing an error when the user cancels out of the prompt. A GUI may be added later to this
project to allow the user to play the game in the browser and press buttons for their options instead
of typing them in the console.
