# rock-paper-scissors
This is a simple program that lets the user play rock, paper, scissors
in their web browser. The last update changed it from being a game in the
console to a game on the user interface. The play plays best out of 5
against the computer and can replay as many times as they want. Building this
game helped me learn more about manipulating the DOM with JavaScript
